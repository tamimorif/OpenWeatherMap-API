Build a command-line tool that fetches weather data for a user-specified location
using an API like OpenWeatherMap.
The tool should take the location as a command-line argument and then
display the current weather conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed)
for that location.

Here are some steps to get started:

Sign up for an API key with OpenWeatherMap (or any other weather API provider).
Use a Go HTTP client to make a GET request
to the API endpoint to fetch weather data for the specified location.
Parse the response JSON to extract
the relevant weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed).
Display the weather data in a user-friendly format on the command line.
